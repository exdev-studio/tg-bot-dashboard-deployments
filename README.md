# Telegram Bot Dashboard Deployments

Telegram Bot Dashboard Infrastructure Deployments.  
As it was decided to use IaaS tools, so we need to ability for local testing.

## Run

To run the deployments you need Docker installed and run the following:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

You need to do this in `deployments/dev` folder. This will launch all the needed local dev deployments.  
As soon as you're done with it, you could start developing and testing processes.
